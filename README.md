# qiskit

I took a quantum computing class in Fall 2020, and I'm including some sample code I wrote to perform quantum operations in Qiskit (opensource QC library). Highlights: 

Deutsch-Josza Circuit (Hw12/13)

Grover Search Algorithm for unstructured database (hw15) and for SAT solving (hw16) which provides a quadratic speedup over classical computers

Quantum teleportation/intraportation circuit (hw18)

Superdense coding (hw19)
